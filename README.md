# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn add hardhat

yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts

yarn add @chainlink/contracts

yarn hardhat compile

yarn hardhat deploy --tags crypta --network rinkeby
```
